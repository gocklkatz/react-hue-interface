# Control your Philips Hue

Philips Hue (https://www.philips-hue.com/) is a product line of smart lights by Signify N.V. (https://www.signify.com/). As an excercise I set out to create a React App to control lights, plugs and schedules of my Philips Hue system.

## Setup instructions

- Clone this app
- Specify your Hue API key in src/key.js

export const properties = {
    key: "PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
};

- Start app
- Enjoy
